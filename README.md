# Fantasy-Premier-League-Recommender
This is a Fantasy Premier League Recommender that uses different machine learning models to create the perfect combination of players  for the best results in an FPL game week. I will be updating the visualizations every now and then. Keep an eye !
This repository uses dataset from https://github.com/vaastav/Fantasy-Premier-League . Big shoutout to the guys over there.
